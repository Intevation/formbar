Formbar
=======

Formbar is a python library to layout, render and validate HTML forms in web
applications. Formbar renders forms which are compatible with [Twitter
Bootstrap](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) styles.

In contrast to many other form libraries forms with formbar are configured in XML
files to separate the form definition form the implementation and handle it as
configuration.

Formbar uses a subset of the
[FormAlchemy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/FormAlchemy/>) as underlying
library for rendering and basic validation.
