- Added Testcases for i18n.

0.2.2
=====

- Added a new DatefieldRenderer which uses a bootstrap specific datepicker
  widget. Needs JS. Currently this widget is used if the datetype "date" is
  provided.
- Added helper method to get the needed JS code for formbar. Needed in other
  libraries.
- Renderer is not set depending on the datatype anymore. Default renderer is
  a TextfieldRenderer or the Renderer set by Formencode.

- Fix in setup.py. Use hgtools to build package.
